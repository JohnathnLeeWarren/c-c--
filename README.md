# c/c--

I'm learning C++ and I'll periodically upload more small maybe big projects to this repository. Please for give me for any miss spelling.
Most if not all my C++ files are written in VS CODE. Some are in CODE BLOCKS but I perfer VS CODE. All projects are uploaded from VS
though. I'm still learning so my code maybe not look professional or well organized at the moment. I do look forward to any comments or
criticism. 

The SIMPLE ATM project is just a simple math application with a somewhat login/signup function.
